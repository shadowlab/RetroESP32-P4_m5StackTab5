# 🕹️ RetroESP32-P4

### Fifteen game consoles and native PC-era shooters — on a single ESP32-P4 microcontroller.

**No GPU. No Linux. Bare-metal RISC-V.**

RetroESP32-P4 is an open-source retro-gaming and application platform built on the **ESP32-P4** — a dual-core RISC-V microcontroller with no dedicated GPU. Grown out of a revival of the original [RetroESP32](https://github.com/retro-esp32/RetroESP32), it brings a modern touchscreen launcher, **HDMI output**, **15 emulators**, and **native apps that execute from PSRAM** — including full Doom and Quake.

The headline: SNES, Genesis/Mega Drive and the mighty **NeoGeo** all run at **60 FPS**.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- 🎮 **15 emulators** — NES through NeoGeo, all with save/load states
- ⚡ **60 FPS** on the 16-bit heavyweights (SNES, Genesis, NeoGeo)
- 🧩 **Native apps from PSRAM** — Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem 3D, OpenTyrian
- 🖥️ **Two builds from one firmware** — 4.3″ touchscreen handheld *or* HDMI console
- 🎛️ **Any USB gamepad** — auto-detected and auto-mapped on first use
- 💾 **Save states** on every core, some accessible in-game
- 📦 **Everything included** — firmware, source, SD files, apps, PCB, schematic, and case STLs

## 🎮 Supported Emulators

| Family | Systems |
|--------|---------|
| **Nintendo** | NES · Game Boy · Game Boy Color · **SNES** ⭐ |
| **Sega** | Master System · Game Gear · **Genesis / Mega Drive** ⭐ |
| **Atari** | 2600 · 800XL / 5200 · 7800 · Lynx |
| **Arcade & more** | **NeoGeo** ⭐ · PC Engine · ColecoVision · Sinclair ZX |

⭐ = hand-tuned to hold **60 FPS** on the P4.

> Atari 2600 and 800XL/5200 support paddle controllers for Breakout, Kaboom! and the like in console (HDMI) mode.

### ⚡ Performance

- Most systems run at **60 FPS with no frame-skip**.
- **SNES / Genesis** — locked 60 FPS via a real-time frame pacer (a handful of *rendered* frames may drop under heavy load; game logic and audio stay at full speed, so play feels perfectly smooth).
- **NeoGeo** — 60 FPS, fully operational, fed by a sprite cache with batched bank prefetch.

### 💾 Save States

**All** emulators support Save / Load states — several directly from the in-game menu.

## 🎛️ Controllers

Plug in **any** USB controller and automatic button mapping starts on first use.

![USB controllers — SNES-style and PS3-style](images/image-20260419093753500.png)

> On the **HDMI** build, SNES and Genesis map Menu and Volume to **L2/R2**, so a PS3-style pad works best. Inexpensive clones are widely available.

## 🖥️ Supported Hardware

### 1. Guition ESP32-P4 4.3″ LCD — the handheld

A single [480×800 touchscreen module](https://www.guition.com/esp32p4-display-module/esp32p4-display) becomes a full handheld (the one pictured up top, in a 3D-printed shell). Available on AliExpress or from Guition.

### 2. HDMI Version — the console

Drive a TV by pairing the Guition ESP32-P4 board with an **Olimex LT8912 MIPI-DSI-to-HDMI bridge**.

> ⚠️ **Use the correct DSI flat cable** — a mismatched ribbon will not work. Buy it from Olimex: [FPC-15-1.0-150](https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP32-P4/FPC-15-1.0-150/).

## 🧩 Native Apps from PSRAM

Beyond emulators, RetroESP32-P4 runs **native** applications. A compact app format (**PAPP**) loads binaries off the SD card, memory-maps them into PSRAM, and executes them in place through a shared, versioned service ABI — so you can add apps **without reflashing firmware**.

Included:

- **Doom**
- **Quake**
- **Duke Nukem 3D**
- **OpenTyrian**
- Example demo template (build your own)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Format an SD card to **FAT32**.
2. Copy the contents of **`/SDCARD`** onto it.
3. Build the merged firmware image and flash it to address **`0`** using the [web esptool](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/)
   (prebuilt images are no longer kept in the repository):
   - **`RetroESP32_P4_v1.bin`** — handheld / LCD build (`build_all.ps1`)
4. Insert the SD card.
5. Connect a USB controller (or use the built-in console frame).
6. **NeoGeo only:** run the included Python script once to generate the sprite-cache files (script is in the SD-card folder).
7. Power on, pick a system, and play. 🎉

## 🧠 Under the Hood

- **One image per emulator** — each core is its own OTA flash partition; the launcher switches the active partition and reboots straight into the game, so every emulator gets the whole chip.
- **PPA hardware scaler** — with no GPU, the P4's on-chip 2D Pixel-Processing Accelerator handles rotation, scaling and format conversion.
- **Execute-in-place apps** — the PAPP loader maps SD-card binaries into PSRAM and calls them through a service vtable.
- **Dual-core scheduling** — hot paths pinned to internal SRAM/IRAM; the second core carries audio and display so game logic keeps pace.

**Silicon:** ESP32-P4 · dual-core RISC-V @ 360 MHz · 32 MB PSRAM · 16 MB flash.
